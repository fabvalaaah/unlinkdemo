# unlinkdemo
C unlinking file demonstration for Linux.

This is a C NetBeans project, compiled with GCC 5.4.0 and tested with Ubuntu
Linux 16.04.3 LTS x64.

This piece of software shows how a program that creates/opens a file and
immediately unlinks it from the file-system (looks like it has been deleted) is
still able to manipulate it as long as a reference to the file handler is kept.

Usage example: "./unlinkdemo foo" will unlink a file called "foo".
